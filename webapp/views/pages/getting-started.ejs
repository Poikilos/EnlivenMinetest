<h2>Vegetable Farming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Super glow glass allows plants to grow without sunlight</li>
<li>Grass sometimes yields wheat seeds</li>
<li>Plants in the wild may be vegetables that you can eat or replant to
multiply them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Animal Farming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep feeding the correct food to an animal to tame it. For
currently-known taming info not displayed here, see the enhancement
request for this webapp (the request has the taming info shown already)
at <a href="https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest/issues/88">
Taming Guide</a></li>
<li>A nametag names a tamed animal.</li>
<li>A Mob Protection Rune prevents an animal from being killed.</li>
<li>There is a known issue with animals despawning: see
<a href="https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest/issues/3">Neutral
Mobs Despawn Frequently</a> issue on GitHub.com/EnlivenMinetest to track
this issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mining</h2>
<h3>Maximum Mining Depths</h3>
You must go below the maximum to get the material. Many materials also
have a deeper level below which they are more common.
Only a few materials stop occurring at lower depths (see "Minimum"
column).

Bring food (and wood to make torches and other tools) to survive deep
underground.<br/>
Set home and go home using the inventory menu. The house button with the
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkred">red</span>
arrow sets home. If you die you can always click the house button with
the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkgreen">green</span> arrow
to go back home.<br/>
You can set additional homes by typing: /sethome, or /sethome2; then
return by typing /home, or /home2.
<h2>Protecting Your Builds and Items</h2>
<h3>Area Self-Protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Type /area_pos set (including the slash)</li>
<li><b>Select the area</b> by clicking the opposite corners you want to
protect. Remember you're in 3D so you must consider that one should be
an upper corner and the other should be a lower corner, in addition to
being opposite from a top view.<br/>
Alternatively, use /area_pos set1 or /area_pos set2 to set the corners
separately.
</li>
<li>Type /protect AreaName (where AreaName is what you want to name your
area)</li>
<li>The default number of areas you can have
(areas.self_protection_max_areas) is 3, but this may be different in
each world <i>(See minetest/minetest.conf for single player. For servers,
see games/game/minetest.conf or worlds/world/world.conf)</i>.</li>
</ul>
To remove an area or remove a player from an area:
<ul>
    <li>* type /remove_area ID (where ID is the number you see at the
    bottom left when you are in the area--use the one for the player you
    want to remove)</li>
</ul>
To add additional players to your area:
<ul>
<li>Go to your area to see the ID (number) at the bottom left.</li>
<li>/select_area ID (but put the number instead of ID)<br/>
Alternatively, select a smaller area within the area (see "Select the
area" above).</li>
<li>/add_owner ID playername SubAreaName (but put the number instead of
ID; the SubAreaName can be the same as AreaName, but if you selected
a smaller part of your area manually, you may want to use a different
name to show that it uses different positions for the corners.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your server's "areas.self_protection_privilege" may differ. For example,
it is build and you don't have the build privelege, you will getting a
message saying "required privelege: build." You should consult the
policies of the server you are on. You may be able to ask a moderator
with the basic_privs privelege to type "/grant playername build" where
"playername" is your player name.
</p>
<h3>Protection Blocks</h3>
Protection blocks are an easy way to protect the area around them.
<ul>
<li>Protection Blocks protect your area from other players</li>
<li>You can add other players to your protection block by name.</li>
<li>Protected chests &amp; doors: Anyone who is on the protection block
can use them.</li>
<li>Locked chests &amp; doors: Only the person who placed them can use
them, unless a key is made and given to another player (use skeleton key
on a locked target to change the skeleton into a key for the target
you're opening).</li>
<li>Your bones hold your items when you die. After one hour, other
players can take the items.</li>
<li><b>Moderators</b> may not be able to recover your items regarding
unprotected areas or items, since proving ownership or where items ended
up may be difficult or impossible. Always make sure anything you want to
keep is protected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<b>Only if your server uses ENLIVEN</b>, report issues at
<a href="https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest/issues">
github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest/issues</a>
and include a screenshot (F12 saves screenshot to the minetest/bin
folder). You can often show what node the item is by pointing at it and
turning on the debug screen with F5. Otherwise, report them to a
moderator of your server (if you report it to a moderator first, the
issue is likely to be resolved faster).
<h2>Minetest Settings</h2>
All of the settings below can be followed from the Minetest Settings tab
(exit to menu if you are in-game, then click Settings).
<h3>Brightness</h3>
All Settings, Graphics, In-Game, Advanced, "Light Curve Mid Boost = 0.5"
(default 0.2): recommended when using Filmic Tone Mapping (In-game,
Shaders, Tone Mapping, Filmic tone mapping), which makes dark areas
almost black in caves where there is no moonlight. Caves are dark. Make
torches. Changing your settings so you can mine in the dark is "cheaty."
<a name="cheaty"></a>Doing things that are "cheaty" lead to an immature
pointless game of getting more blocks than anyone else. Make a cool mine
with cool torches. Make an awesome railway that you and other players
can ride (remember to protect it--see above).

<h3>Screenshot Location &amp; Format</h3>
All Settings, Graphics, Menus, then change "Screenshot folder" and
"Screenshot format" if desired (recommended: make a Screenshots
directory in your computer's Pictures folder and use that, and use jpg
format to save space).

<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
If you feel like something is lacking such as features found in other
games, <b>and your server uses ENLIVEN</b>, consider visiting the
<a href="https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest/issues/58">Not in
Minetest - Feedback Forum</a> issue on the EnlivenMinetest GitHub
project. Otherwise, contact a moderator of your server (you can still
visit the link to get an idea of what mods are available for Minetest
servers).
