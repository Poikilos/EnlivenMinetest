### Removed
- This may have worked after additional fixes. I thought this was the
  fault but it apparently was not.

```python
register(
    "python_fu_remove_halo",
    "Remove Halo",
    "Remove alpha",
    "Jake Gustafson", "Jake Gustafson", "2020",
    "Remove Halo",  # caption
    "RGBA",  # RGB* would mean with or without alpha.
    [
        (PF_SPINNER, "threshold", "Minimum alpha to fix", 254, (0, 255, 1)),
        (PF_BOOL, "make_opaque", "Make the fixed parts opaque.", True),
        (PF_DRAWABLE, "drawable", "Input layer", None),
    ],
    [],
    remove_layer_halo,
    menu="<Image>/Layer"
)
```

- This kind of register call may be deprecated, even though it matches
  the docs.
