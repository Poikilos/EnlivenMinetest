How to use a Blender script:
- Copy the entire script to the clipboard (open it in Geany or another editor, Edit, Select All, Edit, Copy)
- Open Blender (ensure the Blender version is in the range of versions recommended by the script's comments).
- Hover over the edge of the 3D view and right-click, then click "Split Vertically"
- Click the editor drop-down (looks like: #o while in 3D View), then choose "Text Editor"
- Click Text, New
- Paste the entire script (Edit, Paste)
- Follow the instructions at the top of the script.
