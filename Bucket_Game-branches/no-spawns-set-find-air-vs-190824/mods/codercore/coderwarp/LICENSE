----------------------------------------------------------------------

This mod will need changes to the world ".conf" file and to "init.lua"
for each world.

By default,  dynamic spawn management is used.  To use a single  fixed
spawnpoint,  add  two settings  of the  following  form  to the  world
".conf" file:

disable_multispawn = true
static_spawn_point = 10, 10, 5

The  dynamic spawn management code is  similar to  code by Pitriss and
Octactian but  is believed to have evolved independently and to be un-
der the WTFPL.
