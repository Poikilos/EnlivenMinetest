## Texture is "familiar"
- If you change it to half res, it is nearly exactly the same as
  the Minecraft skeleton's texture. There was no attempt to hide the
  pixel-perfect similarity in the outline, eyes, or mouth. A row of
  light pixels changes the shape of the nose, and the resolutions is
  doubled and noise is added. The outline of the major features and
  the alpha outline match the actual Minecraft texture almost exactly,
  as if the Minecraft one was scaled to 2x with nearest neighbor scaling
  and as a basis. See:

## Sounds are "familiar"
- "death" may be original, but sounds awefully similar to other sounds
  at higher speeds with equalization, such as hurt1 from Minecraft.
- "random" is "say1" (exactly) from Minecraft.
- "hurt" sounds like a processed version of "hurt1" from Minecraft.
