## Changes by Poikilos
* added knees
* made neck straight as is normal for birds in flight
* removed wierd "arms" connecting wings to body (3 bones is the correct amount for a bird wing)
* retextured, improved UV map
* fixed up wing proportions (thanks for goose photo earlier, Slopsbucket)
* changed old texture slightly to make it into a gosling. Texture transparency reduces wingspan. I baked it onto a new texture to translate it to the new UV map like the adult.
* altered size to match real life (size*10 for minetest units)
* bird legs fold the other way guys...
* [ ] animate
* [ ] eventually add more goose types (textures)
