"coderskins" is a Minetest "skins" mod that is  designed  to work with
the  Bucket World "_game" or derived "_games".  It won't work in other
contexts.

This mod  is  inspired by  older Minetest  "skins" mods, but is suffi-
ciently different that it should be viewed as a new mod.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The mod supports 64x64 skins and,  additionally,  sets  random default
skins for new players.

To install  a specific skin  for a specific player,  name the PNG file
to be used as follows:

      player_NAME.png

where NAME is  the player's in-game nick.  Then copy the PNG file into
the mod's "textures" directory.

The PNG file should be  a standard  Minetest 64x32 or  Minecraft 64x64
"skin" file.

Or, if you prefer,  create a text file, in the mod's "textures" direc-
tory with a similar filename:

      player_NAME.skin

In the text file,  put the filename of the PNG file to be used for the
associated player's skin.  The  PNG file should  be stored in the same
directory.

If  a "player_NAME.png" file and a  "player_NAME.skin"  file  are both
present for a particular player, the PNG file takes precedence.
