This folder exists so you can copy `code-workspace` files from projects
to here then modify them to suit your needs. Files other than this text
file will be ignored by git to prevent git pull issues, so backup any
`code-workspace` files or other files you add to this folder.

Edit `code-workspace` files to include your relative path to minetest,
but you must leave the path to `run-any` intact--unless you change it to
an absolute path (required if you put your `code-workspace` file
somewhere else; This subfolder is here as relative paths in the included
code-workspaces for run-any will only resolve if the code-workspace is
in a direct subfolder of the repo).

The purpose is:
- You can click on paths in your IDE to jump to the Lua code.
  - To make this possible consistently, install outputinspector
    as described in readme.md, as it can unmangle paths & lines.
- For details and troubleshooting, see "run-any" in readme.md:
