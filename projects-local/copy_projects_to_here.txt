This folder exists so you can copy `code-workspace` files from projects
to here then modify them to suit your needs. Files other than this text
file will be ignored by git to prevent git pull issues, so backup any
`code-workspace` files or other files you add to this folder.

Edit `code-workspace` files to include your relative path to minetest,
but you must leave the path to `run-any` intact unless you change it to
an absolute path which is required to put your `run-any`
`code-workspace` file somewhere else (This subfolder is here so relative
paths in the included code-workspaces for run-any will work when copied
here)

The purpose is:
- You can click on paths in your IDE to jump to the Lua code.
  - outputinspector unmangles errors if installed as described in readme.md.
- For details and troubleshooting, see "run-any" in readme.md:
