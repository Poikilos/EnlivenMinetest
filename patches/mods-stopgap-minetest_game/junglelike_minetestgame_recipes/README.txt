Minetest Game mod: junglelike_minetestgame_recipes
==================================================
This mod provides a useful way to obtain items related to jungle grass when jungle biomes are rare or missing from your world limit area, and you don't have plantlife_modpack and therefore can't use junglelike_dryplants_recipes (or you want to make items obtained via crafting recipes below easier, in which case you can install this even if you already meet requirements for junglelike_dryplants_recipes and have that mod installed).


Main Features:
--------------
New moreblocks:sweeper recipe from grass
Craft 8 "Cotton" (farming:cotton, formerly default:string) into Cotton Seed (cotton can be obtained from spiders which are found via desert biomes or via spider spawners)
