Minetest Game mod: junglelike_dryplants_recipes
===============================================
This mod provides a useful way to obtain items related to jungle grass when jungle biomes are rare or missing from your world limit area
NOTE: Obtaining cotton seeds is only possible via trmp_minetest_game (or custom loot table; or possibly mob drops if that is setup on your server) if there is no jungle biome. Make sure that challenge is not too high for your tastes, otherwise also install junglelike_minetestgame_recipes.

Requirements:
-------------
Ponds generated after plantlife_modpack (since they contain Reedmace)
See depends.txt

Main Features:
--------------
New rope block recipe using Reedmace
New rope recipe using Cotton (farming:cotton formerly default:string)
Reedmace sometimes drops cotton seeds
