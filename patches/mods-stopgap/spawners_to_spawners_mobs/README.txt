Minetest Game mod: spawners_to_spawners_mobs
=========================
This mod provides a transition from spawners (old non-modpack version) in case of existing worlds, so you can use the new modpack version of spawners instead, which still uses mobs_monsters [mobs redo monsters] but also uses spawners_mobs:mummy (formerly spawners:mummy).
