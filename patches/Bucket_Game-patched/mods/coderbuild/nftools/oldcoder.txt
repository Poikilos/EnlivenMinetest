Nftools adds additional minerals and tools to minetest.
New tools:
* Battle Axe (low level weapon, does knockback occasionally)
* Mace (high level weapon)
* Scythe

The Original version by Sam Hocevar adds the following minerals:
Amber (block and "chip")

Poikilos' fork is designed to compliment birthstones by making the
following changes:
* Changed alexandrite (overlap with birthstones):
  to bismuth (it already looked somewhat like bismuth)
* Changed amethyst (modified texture until looked like black opal):
  to black opal.
* Changed aquamarine:
  to turquoise
* Use standard texture naming conventions
  (change nftools_*ore.png to nftools_mineral_*.png,
  nftools:*_ore to nftools:stone_with_*,
  nftools:amber to nftools:stone_with_amber)
* The old minerals in the world converted to the one following the comma:
  `nftools:amethyst, nftools:black_opal`
  `nftools:alexandrite_ore, nftools:bismuth`
  `nftools:aquamarine, nftools:turquoise`

Unrelated changes:
* Battle Axe, Mace, and Scythe textures
* Tint of amber nodes is now amber (with yellow highlights) instead of
  yellow. Blending is improved, and texture is 16% transparent.
* Bismuth texture is more angular to look even more like bismuth
* Improve ore textures (nftools_mineral_*.png)
* fixed issue where aquamarine ore drops ore
* removed all smelting (smelting gemstones? really? not anymore)
  except Bismuth (formerly nftools:alexandrite)
* Register each craftitem before referencding it as a drop.
* Make missing recipe for quartz crystals node (displayable quartz)
