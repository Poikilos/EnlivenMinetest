2. "nftools" adds new minerals and tools.

New tools include:

* Battle Axe (low level weapon, does knockback occasionally)
* Mace (high level weapon)
* Scythe

Poikilos  has  made  changes  designed to  make  "nftools"  complement
"birthstones". His changes include:

* Changed alexandrite (overlap with birthstones):
  to bismuth (it already looked somewhat like bismuth)

* Changed amethyst (modified texture until looked like black opal):
  to black opal.

* Changed aquamarine:
  to turquoise

* Use standard texture naming conventions
  (change nftools_*ore.png to nftools_mineral_*.png,
  nftools:*_ore to nftools:stone_with_*,
  nftools:amber to nftools:stone_with_amber)
* The old minerals in the world converted to the one following the comma:
  `nftools:amethyst, nftools:black_opal`
  `nftools:alexandrite_ore, nftools:bismuth`
  `nftools:aquamarine, nftools:turquoise`
  (using aliases)

Other changes:

* Battle Axe, Mace, and Scythe textures

* Tint of amber nodes is now amber (with yellow highlights) instead of
  yellow. Blending is improved, and texture is 16% transparent.

* Bismuth texture is more angular to look even more like bismuth
* Improve ore textures (nftools_mineral_*.png)
* Fixed issue where aquamarine ore drops ore
* Removed all smelting except for Bismuth
* Register each craftitem before referencing it as a drop
* Add missing recipe for quartz crystals node (displayable quartz)
