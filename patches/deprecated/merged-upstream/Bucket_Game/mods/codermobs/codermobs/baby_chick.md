I had watched a YouTube video of chicks but didn't measure the speed.
I also halved the speed below.
Today I did some research on chickens, and accounted for 10 Blender units being 1 Minetest unit.
Adult chickens run around 9mph normally. That's 4.02 m/s (meters/sec). They are about .37 m tall. Ours our an exaggerated size, .63 but that's ok for illustration purposes. Some chickens are that tall or taller.
Reverse the equation to get chick speed from size:
The chick, at size x10, is .53 m tall. Therefore, ratio of adult to immature is .63:.53. Maybe change it to two thirds: .63:.42 
Then change animation speed to match proportionally (to avoid foot sliding).
See updated code for details:
