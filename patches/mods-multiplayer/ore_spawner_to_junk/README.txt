Minetest mod: orespawner_to_junk
==========================================
A full fork is planned with a minetest configuration option to disable spawners to prevent this issue in the first place
(however, this mod is helpful when the ore generators already exist in the world).
Ore generation (from spawners mod) is not good for multiplayer balance so there should be an option to turn it off.
You must also remove the lines from spawners/spawners_ores.lua
(see spawners-microfork for version with this done already)
