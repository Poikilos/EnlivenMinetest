How to use the image:
  # docker options:
  # -i: is interactive (attach STDIN).
  # -d: is daemon mode.

  sudo docker image ls
  # ^ See what images are installed (one image can be used for many containers).

  sudo docker rmi $image_name
  # ^ Remove a docker image (This is necessary after updating the unversioned Docker image to avoid cached RUN commands from doing nothing when the script after RUN changes).

  sudo docker image prune
  # ^ Prune unused images (For this to do anything, first delete containers using the image).

  sudo docker ps -a
  # ^ List containers and show NAMES (The name is necessary for certain subcommands such as exec which operate on a running container).

  sudo docker start $container_name
  # ^ Start a container.

  sudo docker run $container_name
  # ^ "run" is merely a combination of "create" and "start"

  sudo docker -w $contained_repo exec $container_name ls -l $contained_repos
  sudo docker -w $contained_repo exec $container_name $run_all_build_commands_script
  # ^ Execute a command in a running container (exec shows an error if the container isn't running).
  # This will not work if the run/start command that started the container isn't a command that keeps it open (runs indefinitely)!
  # If you need a container that has changes after $run_all_build_commands_script runs, you must use the "commit" subcommand.
  # w: working directory

  sudo docker stop $container_name
  # ^ Stop a container by name (See <https://www.tecmint.com/name-docker-containers/>)
  #   You must use the container name (as determined using the "ps" subcommand), not the image name.

  sudo docker container run -it $image_name /bin/bash
  # ^ Run an interactive terminal (Type 'exit' to exit)
  #   (based on <https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-run-command-with-examples>)

  sudo docker attach $container_name
  # ^ Attach your current terminal to a running container (See
  #   <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/>).


  sudo docker rm --force $container_name
  # ^ Delete a container by its name.
  # --force: kill and delete running containers as well.

END

# How to use docker-compose (See <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>):
# "1. Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere."
# "2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment."
# "3. Run docker compose up and the Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run docker-compose up using the docker-compose binary."
