# EnlivenMinetest

1. ENLIVEN is a subgame for minetest with the goals of providing immersion and lessons for humanity.
(see also webapp/README.md)
2. The [ENLIVEN project](https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest) (aka EnlivenMinetest) includes tools for installing and maintaining the server and client for internet and LAN use, and now includes the mtanalyze (formerly minetest-chunkymap) project which includes many tools including chunkymap. The server and client are just the Minetest server and client repackaged (or just web installer scripts in the case of the server), and therefore 100% compatible with other copies of Minetest server and client of the same version--including using other subgames, which client will download from servers as usual.

## Primary Features of EnlivenMinetest Project
* Server installer for ENLIVEN on linux server (Ubuntu so far)
* Client installer for single-player ENLIVEN, including on Windows
* automatically install Minetest client with a usable minetest.conf (for improved graphics)

## Primary Features of ENLIVEN subgame
* birthstones, improved fork: <https://github.com/poikilos/birthstones>
  (also part of Bucket_Game)

### Planned Features
There are several improvements I may implement in new or existing mods. See the [Issues](https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest/issues) section of the GitHub project.
* See also install-ENLIVEN-minetest_game.sh for a full list of mods from the old ENLIVEN that will probably be added to the new ENLIVEN which is based on Bucket_Game (many of the mods are already present because they are in Bucket_Game!)
* Issues not yet added to the GitHub project's Issues are at [Minetest Kanboard](https://poikilos.dyndns.org/kanboard/?controller=BoardViewController&action=readonly&token=f214530d2f1294d90279631ce66b2e8b8569c6f15faf3773086476158bc8)

#### node.js server manager
* capture log
  * do not store redundant messages such as hunger_ng debug mode (see <https://pastebin.com/dDBg40vf>) or saving playereffects
  * detect restarts (even if no 'separator'--see <https://pastebin.com/Jv3vkhFA>)

## DISCLAIMERS
* Please read the Sources and License section of this document. You must agree to the licenses mentioned in order to use and copy this program.
* Any script code related to redis has not been successfully tested.
* Make sure you convert your world to leveldb and place it in your server's worlds folder $HOME/.minetest/worlds/, as this set of scripts hasn't been tested with any other database nor worlds folder location, and nightly backup scripts cater to leveldb.

## How to use:

### Windows Client:
Click "Releases" for the installer, which has the singleplayer and multiplayer client for ENLIVEN.
* alternate download site is [expertmultimedia.com](http://www.expertmultimedia.com/index.php?htmlref=tutoring.html "Expert Multimedia")
* you must install to C:\Games\ENLIVEN (or possibly other path without spaces, as long as you don't move the launcher) in order for ENLIVEN to run.
ENLIVEN subgame is a subgame of Minetest
The ENLIVEN client runs Minetest, which can be used as a client for other Minetest servers with different subgames, but has these advantages:
* is able to be installed automatically
* comes with high quality OpenGL graphics settings in minetest.conf for modern computers
* is able to run ENLIVEN subgame in singleplayer mode without any changes

### Server

### mtanalyze
(not maintained, kept for legacy use--if you fix anything, please submit a pull request)
* mtanalyze is a set of tools including a live map for Minetest servers and singleplayer if using LevelDB
* for more information, see README.md in mtanalyze folder.

#### Customization
* The farming plugin is overwritten with farming redo in the minetest_game based install script. Bucket_Game already has something good, apparently based on farming redo.
* Before using anything in the change_world_name_manually_first and subfolders, change the values of the variables in the folder name as noted before using.
* If you have a dedicated server, the value server_dedicated = false should be changed to server_dedicated = true in your SERVER's minetest.conf in the ENLIVEN folder that the installer creates.

#### Security and Performance Notes
* The installer script changes owner and group for ENLIVEN's world.mt and world.mt.1st if present to $USER
* The included minetest.conf recommended for your clients includes the line enable_local_map_saving = true, which will cache the world locally on their machines. You can feel free to change that according to your preference.

## Naming conventions:
* The filenames without extensions
* The abbreviation "mts" is for minetest server-specific scripts or variables
* du-show-big searches your hard drive for big files, in case $HOME/.minetest/debug.txt fills your drive, or a log rotate utility fails (going into a cumulative copy loop, or not) in regard to debug.txt, filling up your drive
* The network folder contains some stuff for networks, which is usually only useful for using Minetest in a network cafe or school.
(The purpose of minetest_userscript_localENLIVEN_server_only.vbs is to make sure the user only uses the hostname localENLIVEN, however this only changes the default, and cannot be enforced in any way as far as I know without recompiling the client.)

## Changes
see CHANGELOG.md

## Network Deployment
* minetest_userscript_localENLIVEN_server_only.vbs logon script in network folder only works if you make C:\games\Minetest writable to Authenticated Users, in order for minetest.conf to be created via this script (feel free to offer comments on how to avoid making the entire Minetest folder writable to Authenticated Users [I haven't experimented with which of the files and subfolders can be set to do not inherit])
* minetest_userscript_localENLIVEN_server_only.vbs does not read the recommended minetest.conf, so it echoes the lines manually. Ideally it would analyze the recommended one and change the server settings.

## Building
* scripts and sources for recreating ENLIVEN subgame are at the EnlivenMinetest project page: https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest
Further steps needed to recreate:
* extract entire zip from sfan5
* run postinstall.bat
* change version number in C:\Users\Owner\Documents\GitHub\EnlivenMinetest\winclient\install ENLIVEN.iss
* change version number in C:\Users\Owner\Documents\GitHub\EnlivenMinetest\winclient\launcher-src\ENLIVEN.pro

### additional notes
* The recommended minetest.conf for subgame, including for server, is in the ENLIVEN subgame folder (also available at [EnlivenMinetest on GitHub](https://github.com/poikilos/EnlivenMinetest)
